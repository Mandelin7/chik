<h1>Windows Installer</h1>
<p>Download the Windows installer (exe) or Zip file - <a href="https://github.com/Chik-Network/chik-blockchain/releases" rel="nofollow">Chik Blockchain Windows</a></p>
<p>As the Chik code signing certificate is new you will likely have to ask to keep the download and when you run the installer, you will have to choose "More Info" and "Run Anyway" to be able to run the installer. There is no need to use the command line. Some Windows antivirus applications are seeing the download as a false positive. You can see the entire source code and build method here, so we think it's safe for you to ask those tools to ignore it. Running the installer while plotting on a previous version will stop your plotting process, so be careful.</p>
